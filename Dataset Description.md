We collected real-time hematology reports from the patients of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU). The Sysmex XN-2000™ Auto Hematology Analyzer, which provides accurate and reliable five-part hematology results from just 20 uL of blood, was used to gather the reports. For each blood test, this analyzer stores more than 200 hematological parameters. Some of these parameters are calculated by the analyzer. Other parameters were inserted manually by the operator, such as gender and age. The dataset contains 1004 samples of reports. The CBC test contains many attributes. But among them, we used only eleven attributes that were efficient for our work. After collecting these data, we input them into a csv file. Then we labelled the dataset for multiclass classification. Non-Anemic:  0, Mild: 1, Moderate: 2, Severe: 3, Life-threatening: 4.

Anemia can be defined as a reduction in hemoglobin (less than 13.5 g/dL in men; less than 12.0 g/dL in women), hematocrit (less than 41.0% in men; less than 36.0% in women), or red blood cell (RBC) count.

The grading of anemia, according to the National Cancer Institute, is as follows:
➔    Mild: Hemoglobin 10.0 g/dL to the lower limit of normal
➔    Moderate: Hemoglobin 8.0 to 10.0 g/dL
➔    Severe: Hemoglobin 6.5 to 7.9 g/dL
➔    Life-threatening: Hemoglobin less than 6.5 g/dL
